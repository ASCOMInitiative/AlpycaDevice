Migrating from Earlier Versions to Platform 7
=============================================

Your existing device will continue to run with no changes. However, we recommend that you
migrate to the Platform 7 version of your device's interface. For example if you implemented
iTelescopeV3 with the 0.x version of this SDK, it will continue to work, but your device
will not support the |plat7relnotes|, which are in |itelescopev4|.
