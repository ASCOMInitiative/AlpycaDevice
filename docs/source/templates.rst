Template Responder Class Modules
================================

In the ``templates`` folder you will find Python modules for each ASCOM device
type which contain template responder classes
for each endpoint for that device type. This can be a major time and mistake
saver. Keep in mind that each endpoint corresponds to an ASCOM DeviceInterface
member that is described in the |ascspecs|.
