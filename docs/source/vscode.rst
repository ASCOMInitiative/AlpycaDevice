Python Tooling for Visual Studio Code
=====================================

If you're starting at Python ground zero or even if you're comming from a legacy
Linux environment using vim or another Python IDE, we'd like to suggest you use
|vscode|.  The AlpycaDevice project was developed with VSCode mostly on a
(Linux) Raspberry Pi 4B with 64-bit Bullseye.

The Python workflow tools supplied by Microsoft are excellent, however a few
extensions can make VSCode a huge time saver. You do not need any exotic
Python packages. Per Microsoft, just get the latest production Python
installed then install VSCode per Microsoft's |vspython|.

Once you get Python and VSCode installed, we suggest these additional
extensions (some of which are written by or suggested by Microsoft)

* `Python <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python>`_
* `Pylance <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance>`_
* `Better TOML <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bungcip.better-toml>`_
* `GitLens <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens>`_
* `Pip-Manager <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=slightc.pip-manager>`_
