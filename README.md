## Python 3.7+ Alpaca Device Framework

This project aims to produce a very lightweight framework for a device
driver that supports the Alpaca procol and ASCOM Standards. It implements
a basic Rotator device that is structured in a way that the Rotator-
specific API endpoint implementations can be easily replaced with an
API implementation for any device. The "boiler plate" logic remains the
same.

## Status (December 2022)
