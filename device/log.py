        **MASTER LOGGER**

        This single logger is used throughout. The module name (the param for get_logger())
        isn't needed and would be 'root' anyway, sort of useless. Also the default date-time
        is local time, and not ISO-8601. We log in UTC/ISO format, and with fractional seconds.
        Finally our config options allow for suppression of logging to stdout, and for this
        we remove the default stdout handler. Thank heaven that Python logging is thread-safe!

        This logger is passed around throughout the app and may be used throughout. The
        :py:class:`config.Config` class has options to control the number of back generations
        of logs to keep, as well as the max size (at which point the log will be rotated).
        A new log is started each time the app is started.

    Returns:
        Customized Python logger.
